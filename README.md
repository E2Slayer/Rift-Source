# Rift-Source
Sources of my Rift plugins for League of Legends.

Dlls that are associated with these codes can be found in the below link

https://github.com/E2Slayer/Rift

## Information

**E2Utility** - Contains various features such as Cooldown tracker, Gank alerter, Activator, Jungle Timer(With an exploit) and more. You may find more features in the source codes.

**E2Utility2.0** - It was orginally meant to be a reworked version of E2Utility, but never finished due to Rift closure.

**MataView** - Displays a duration timer on skills effects or items' effects. It has been merged to E2Utility.

**SlayerAIO** - Only Kalista is available. A few bugs still have to be fixed, but functions that calculates E damages are highly accurate. 

### Other things to say

I did not have any plan to release these sources in public because I have created this repo for tracking and back-up'ing my sources for myself.
So, a lot of things are still messy and unorganized, and I was still pretty new at C++ when I was coding those. 

Please understand low quality codes.

And Enjoy ! 

## Special Thanks

* **ZEDith** - Recommended me as a developer in Rift
* **Lizzaran** - A lot of features in E2Utility were inspired by his SFXUtility. Without his codes, I could not release E2Utility. - [Lizzaran](https://github.com/Lizzaran)
* **RMAN** - Serious hard working contributions on Rift SDK, and guided me the way to be a better coder from a newbie coder like me- [RMAN200](https://github.com/rman200)
* **Yoke, Alexsis** - Always have been helpful and enjoyed my plugin. <3
